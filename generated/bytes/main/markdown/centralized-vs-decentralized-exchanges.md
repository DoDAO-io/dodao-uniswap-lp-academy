## Centralized vs Decentralized Exchange


## Centralized vs Decentralized Exchanges

Centralized exchanges have an order book storing all sell and buy orders, while decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap use Automated Market Makers (AMM) for a permissionless trading experience.

## Liquidity in Exchanges

Liquidity is essential for trading. On centralized exchanges, liquidity is accumulated in the order book, while on DEXs, it's provided by liquidity providers in a decentralized way.

## Automated Market Makers (AMMs)

AMMs work like market makers but in an automated, decentralized, and permissionless way. They use smart contracts to manage liquidity and execute trades.


    


---
## AMMs and Trading Pairs

In AMMs like Uniswap, each trading pair has a separate smart contract that stores both assets and is programmed to mediate trades.


    


---
## Pooling in AMMs

AMMs use pooling, allowing liquidity providers and traders to interact with each other through pools of liquidity. This approach is fully automated, with no managers or privileged users.

## Uniswap and AMMs

Uniswap is an example of a decentralized exchange that implements an AMM, allowing permissionless trading and interaction between liquidity providers and traders.
