## Impermanent Loss


## Introduction

Impermanent loss is a term used in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that refers to the temporary loss of value that liquidity providers experience when they provide liquidity to a trading pair.

## Introduction Evaluation

In a DEX, liquidity providers deposit an assets, such as ETH and USDC, into a liquidity pool. Traders can then buy or sell these assets at the market price, which is determined by the balance of assets in the pool.

## Step 3

However, if the price of one asset in the pool changes relative to the other, the liquidity provider's shares in the pool may become imbalanced, resulting in a loss of value. This is because the liquidity provider's share of the pool will now be worth less than what they initially deposited.

## Step 4

This temporary loss of value is called an impermanent loss because it disappears when the pool is rebalanced or when the liquidity provider removes their liquidity from the pool. However, if the price of the assets continues to move against the liquidity provider's position, the impermanent loss can become permanent.

## Step 5

It's important to note that impermanent loss affects liquidity providers, but not traders who buy or sell assets in the pool.
