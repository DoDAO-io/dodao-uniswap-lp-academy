## AMM Benefits


## Introduction


Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and Order Books are two different types of systems for executing trades. An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that allows traders to trade cryptocurrencies and other digital assets without an order book or an intermediary.

AMMs offer many benefits over order books.

## Introduction Evaluation

AMMs provide liquidity to traders with always available prices, while order books require both buyer and seller to agree on a price leading to low liquidity for some assets.

## Step 3

AMMs do not need order matching, using a mathematical formula for price discovery based on the asset ratio in the pool.

## Step 4

Because AMMs utilize smart contracts and mathematical formulas, traders can exchange assets around the clock, while traditional trading is restricted to operating hours.

## Step 5

AMMs have reduced risks of price manipulation compared to order books that are susceptible to it.

## Step 6

Additionally, AMMs have lower barriers to entry, allowing traders to add liquidity to the pool and earn fees instead of requiring significant capital to participate in the market.
