Unlike Uniswap V2, which required all users to provide liquidity across the entire price curve from 0 to infinity, Uniswap V3 allows LPs to selectively allocate capital within the price range they anticipate to yield the highest return.\n\nThis tutorial will guide you through the process of providing liquidity using the Uniswap application.\n\n## Select Pair\nTo start, you need to choose which token pair you want to supply as liquidity.\n\nWhile any pair of ERC-20 tokens is acceptable, each pair has distinct qualities. It would be helpful to evaluate aspects such as Total Value Locked (TVL), trading volume, and the possibility of price divergence between these tokens in the future.\n\nYou can access relevant information about frequently traded token pairs on [Uniswap Info](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools)\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img style=\"max-height:600px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/uniswap-eth-1/Guide/create-a-new-position-uniswap/1682175276579_select_pair_1.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n## Select Fee\nAfter selecting a token pair, the next step is to choose the appropriate fee tier. Uniswap V3 offers three fee tiers for each pair:\n\n1. 0.01% fee tier: suitable for stablecoin pairs with minimal price risk and fees.\n1. 0.05% fee tier: suitable for stabler pairs.\n2. 0.30% fee tier: best for less correlated token pairs that are more exposed to significant price movements.\n3. 1.00% fee tier: designed for exotic assets that are highly prone to price volatility.\nThe app will automatically choose the fee tier with the most liquidity, which is typically the consensus fee tier. In most cases, LPs align around one fee tier for a pair. For instance, the 0.3% tier has 82% of all ETH/USDC liquidity.\n\nIf you're new to LP-ing, it's recommended to use the auto-selected fee tier. Nonetheless, advanced strategies might find it valuable to provide liquidity in the other fee tiers. Keep in mind that LPs who pick a non-consensus fee tier might be using a complex approach to counter certain risks. It's important to do your own research and proceed with caution when evaluating other fee tiers.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img style=\"max-height:600px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/uniswap-eth-1/Guide/create-a-new-position-uniswap/1682175799696_select_fees_2.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n",
