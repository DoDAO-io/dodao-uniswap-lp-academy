      In Uniswap v3, the profit and loss (PnL) for a liquidity provider (LP) are
      primarily determined by two factors: fees earned and changes in asset
      values due to price movements. These can also be affected by other factors
      like gas costs for transactions and impermanent loss, among others.


      1. **Fees Earned**: As an LP, you earn fees on trades that occur within
      the price range you've set for your liquidity. In Uniswap v3, the fees are
      not distributed evenly among all LPs but rather are proportional to the
      amount of liquidity you provide within the active price range. The more
      your liquidity is utilized (i.e., the more trades that happen within your
      set price range), the more fees you earn.

      2. **Changes in Asset Values**: The other component of PnL calculation in
      Uniswap v3 is the changes in the value of the assets you've provided as
      liquidity. This is where the concept of impermanent loss comes into play.

          **Impermanent loss** happens when the price of your assets changes compared to when you deposited them. If the relative price of your two assets changes, you could end up with less value than if you had simply held onto the assets. This loss is "impermanent" because it could be negated if the prices revert back to their original state.

      3. **Gas Costs**: This is especially important in Uniswap v3 because of
      its capital efficiency feature. Liquidity providers might adjust their
      positions more frequently, which incurs Ethereum network transaction (gas)
      fees.


      However, calculating PnL in Uniswap v3 is complex due to these factors and
      others, like the specific price range you choose as a liquidity provider.
      The specific price range and liquidity depth can significantly affect the
      profitability of providing liquidity. Also, other factors such as managing
      liquidity actively or passively, anticipating the market movements, etc.,
      can affect the PnL.

      - **Pooled_assets**: The total value of the position in USD.

      - **APR**: The yearly return rate considering the value of the position
      assets, deposits, withdrawals, gas costs, and staking rewards at current
      prices.

      - **Fee APR**: The yearly return rate based on accrued fees only, without
      considering divergence loss.

      value of the position, fees, and divergence loss, but ignoring gas costs.

      - **Pool_PnL & Total_PnL**: These metrics measure the profit and loss for
      a position. While Pool PnL considers only fees and price divergence, Total
      PnL also factors in gas costs and reward incentives.

      - **Current_assets**: The current amount of tokens associated with this
      liquidity provider (LP) position.

      - **Invested_assets & Withdrawn**: The total assets put into and taken out
