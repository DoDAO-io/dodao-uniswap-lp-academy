      ## Exchanging Assets

      ![](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/uniswap-eth-1/Guide/what-is-a-dex-uniswap/exchange.jpg)


      Cryptocurrencies are exchanged for reasons similar to those in traditional
      financial markets, including investment, trading, hedging, risk
      management, payment purposes, access to new tokens and projects, and
      regulatory compliance. Cryptocurrencies are seen as a new asset class with
      high potential returns and are highly volatile, creating trading
      opportunities for investors. Cryptocurrencies can be used to hedge against
      other investments or to manage risk in a portfolio. They can also be used
      as a means of payment for online transactions or remittances. Investors
      may exchange cryptocurrencies to gain access to new tokens or projects not
      available on traditional markets or to comply with regulations.
