      ## Exchanging Assets

      </div>

      Cryptocurrencies are exchanged for reasons similar to those in traditional
      financial markets, including investment, trading, hedging, risk
      management, payment purposes, access to new tokens and projects, and
      regulatory compliance. Cryptocurrencies are seen as a new asset class with
      high potential returns and are highly volatile, creating trading
      opportunities for investors. Cryptocurrencies can be used to hedge against
      other investments or to manage risk in a portfolio. They can also be used
      as a means of payment for online transactions or remittances. Investors
      may exchange cryptocurrencies to gain access to new tokens or projects not
      available on traditional markets or to comply with regulations.


      ## Traditional Way - Order Book

      <div align="center">

      </div>

      Assets are traded on an exchange through a centralized platform, an order
      book, where buyers and sellers place orders to buy or sell a specific
      asset. Trading involves placing an order, matching orders based on price
      and other parameters, settling the trade, and clearing it through a
      central counterparty. 


      An order book is a list of buy and sell orders for a financial instrument.
      It shows the supply and demand for the asset and allows traders to make
      informed decisions. Each order includes the type, price, quantity, and
      time. Orders are matched and filled based on price and time stamp. Order
      books are used in exchange-traded markets for transparency and price
      discovery.


      ## New Way - Automated Market Maker

      An automated market maker (AMM) is a type of decentralized exchange (DEX)
      protocol that uses a mathematical algorithm to create a market for trading
      assets without market makers. It creates a liquidity pool for each asset
      pair, and the pool's algorithm determines the asset's price based on the
      ratio of tokens in the pool. The AMM algorithm ensures that the pool has
      sufficient funds for trading and adjusts the price according to the
      trading volume and liquidity. AMMs are used in DeFi platforms and are
      popular for their simplicity, transparency, and accessibility.
