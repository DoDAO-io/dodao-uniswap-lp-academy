      ### Recap of Constant Product AMM

      Constant product Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a decentralized exchange
      model that allows users to trade digital assets without the need for an
      order book. It relies on a mathematical formula that keeps the product of
      the two token reserves constant. The most famous example is Uniswap, which
      uses the `x*y=k` formula, where x and y represent the reserves of two
      tokens and k is the constant. This mechanism provides liquidity for trades
      and adjusts the token prices as supply and demand change, while
      incentivizing liquidity providers with fees from trades.


      ### Example of Constant Product AMM

      Let's consider two tokens, A and B, in a constant product AMM. Suppose the
      reserves of tokens are initially x=100 for token A and y=100 for token B,
      making the constant product k=100*100=10,000.


      Here are a few points for different token ratios:

      - If someone buys 10 tokens of A, the new reserve of A becomes 90
      (100-10). To maintain the constant product k, the reserve of B must
      increase: 90*y=10,000, so y≈111.11. The ratio becomes 90:111.11.

      - If someone buys 50 tokens of A, the new reserve of A becomes 50
      (100-50). To maintain the constant product k, the reserve of B must
      increase: 50*y=10,000, so y=200. The ratio becomes 50:200.

      - If someone sells 10 tokens of A, the new reserve of A becomes 110
      (100+10). To maintain the constant product k, the reserve of B must
      decrease: 110*y=10,000, so y≈90.91. The ratio becomes 110:90.91.


      In each example, the constant product AMM adjusts the reserves of A and B
      to maintain the constant k, which in turn affects the token prices as the
      ratio between the two tokens changes.






      ### Issues with AMM Models

      In the previous guide "What is DEX" we learned about different type of
      AMMs and about their pros and cons.  We saw that each Constant Product,
      Constant Mean, and Hybrid offer their benefits, but each have their down
      sides and there is no single AMM that can be used for various asset types
      and for low liquidity. 


      Each of these models take no user input or external input, and are purely
      based on a mathematical formula which primarily considers the token
      quantity, but doesn't consider user preference or asset volatility.  In
      these AMMs, the liquidity provider doesn't have any influence over the
      quantity or the price of the trade. In contrast, a traditional order book
      the user decides the price, which then influences the quantity traded at
      each price range.  


      ### Concentrated Liquidity



      ### Review 

      In contrast, Uniswap v3 enables LPs to concentrate their capital within
      specific price ranges, allowing them to provide greater liquidity at
      desired prices. LPs can construct customized price curves that reflect
      their own preferences, and they can combine multiple concentrated
      positions in a single pool.


      For example, an LP in the ETH/DAI pool may allocate $100 to the price
      ranges of $1,000-$2,000 and an additional $50 to the ranges of
      $1,500-$1,750. This enables an LP to approximate the shape of any
      automated market maker or active order book.
