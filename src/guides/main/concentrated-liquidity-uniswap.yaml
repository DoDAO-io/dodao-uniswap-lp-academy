      ### Review Different AMMs

      In the previous guide "What is DEX" we learned about different type of
      AMMs and about their pros and cons.  We saw that each Constant Product,
      Constant Mean, and Hybrid offer their benefits, but each have their down
      sides and there is no single AMM that can be used for various asset types
      and for low liquidity. 


      Each of these models take no user input or external input, and are purely
      based on a mathematical formula which primarily considers the token
      quantity, but doesn't consider user preference or asset volatility.  In
      these AMMs, the liquidity provider doesn't have any influence over the
      quantity or the price of the trade. In contrast, a traditional order book
      the user decides the price, which then influences the quantity traded at
      each price range.  


      ### Concentrated Liquidity



      ### Review 

      In Uniswap v2 or a Constant Product AMM, liquidity is distributed evenly
      along a price curve that follows the formula x*y=k. This reserves assets
      for all prices between 0 and infinity, but most of the liquidity is not
      utilized. For instance, the v2 DAI/USDC pair reserves only about 0.50% of
      the capital for trading between $0.99 and $1.01, which is the price range
      where LPs would expect to earn the most fees from the highest trading
      volume.


      As a result, v2 LPs only earn fees on a small portion of their capital,
      which may not be enough to compensate for the price risk or impermanent
      loss they take by holding large inventories in both tokens. Furthermore,
      traders often experience high slippage because liquidity is thinly spread
      across all price ranges.


      In contrast, Uniswap v3 enables LPs to concentrate their capital within
      specific price ranges, allowing them to provide greater liquidity at
      desired prices. LPs can construct customized price curves that reflect
      their own preferences, and they can combine multiple concentrated
      positions in a single pool.


      For example, an LP in the ETH/DAI pool may allocate $100 to the price
      ranges of $1,000-$2,000 and an additional $50 to the ranges of
      $1,500-$1,750. This enables an LP to approximate the shape of any
      automated market maker or active order book.
