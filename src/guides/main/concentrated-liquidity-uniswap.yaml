      ### Recap of Constant Product AMM

      Constant product Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a decentralized exchange
      model that allows users to trade digital assets without the need for an
      order book. It relies on a mathematical formula that keeps the product of
      the two token reserves constant. The most famous example is Uniswap, which
      uses the `x*y=k` formula, where x and y represent the reserves of two
      tokens and k is the constant. This mechanism provides liquidity for trades
      and adjusts the token prices as supply and demand change, while
      incentivizing liquidity providers with fees from trades.


      ### Example of Constant Product AMM


      <div align="center">

      </div>


      Let's consider two tokens, A and B, in a constant product AMM. Suppose the
      reserves of tokens are initially x=100 for token A and y=100 for token B,
      making the constant product k=100*100=10,000.


      Here are a few points for different token ratios:

      - If someone buys 10 tokens of A, the new reserve of A becomes 90
      (100-10). To maintain the constant product k, the reserve of B must
      increase: 90*y=10,000, so y≈111.11. The ratio becomes 90:111.11.

      - If someone buys 50 tokens of A, the new reserve of A becomes 50
      (100-50). To maintain the constant product k, the reserve of B must
      increase: 50*y=10,000, so y=200. The ratio becomes 50:200.

      - If someone sells 10 tokens of A, the new reserve of A becomes 110
      (100+10). To maintain the constant product k, the reserve of B must
      decrease: 110*y=10,000, so y≈90.91. The ratio becomes 110:90.91.


      In each example, the constant product AMM adjusts the reserves of A and B
      to maintain the constant k, which in turn affects the token prices as the
      ratio between the two tokens changes.


      ### Limitation of Constant Product AMMs

      While Constant Product AMMs have been widely adopted, they have certain
      limitations


      1. Capital Inefficiency: In Constant Product AMMs, liquidity is spread
      evenly across the entire price curve. This means that a significant
      portion of the deposited assets may not be actively used for trading,
      making the capital usage inefficient. Concentrated liquidity models allow
      liquidity providers to focus their capital on specific price ranges where
      trading is more likely, leading to better capital efficiency and
      potentially higher returns.


      2. Slippage: Constant Product AMMs use a simple x * y = k formula to
      determine token prices, which can result in significant slippage (price
      change due to trade size) for large trades. As the liquidity pool size
      increases, slippage decreases, but it is still a concern for large orders.
      Concentrated liquidity models can reduce slippage by concentrating
      liquidity within narrower price ranges, providing more accurate and stable
      prices.


      3. Limited Customization: Constant Product AMMs do not offer much
      flexibility for liquidity providers in terms of customizing their exposure
      to different tokens or price ranges. Concentrated liquidity models, on the
      other hand, provide more control to liquidity providers by allowing them
      to choose specific price ranges and even adjust their positions as market
      conditions change.


      Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity models address some of the key
      limitations of Constant Product AMMs by offering more efficient capital
      usage, reduced impermanent loss, lower slippage, and increased
      customization options for liquidity providers. These improvements can lead
      to better returns for liquidity providers and a more efficient and stable
      trading experience for users.

      ### What is Concentrated Liquidity AMM?

      Concentrated liquidity AMM is a new approach to decentralized trading that
      allows people to provide liquidity to a market more efficiently. Here's a
      simple explanation:


      1. In traditional AMMs, people deposit two tokens in equal value to create
      a liquidity pool. This pool is used to facilitate trading between those
      two tokens.

      2. In the case of concentrated liquidity AMM, people can choose a specific
      price range where they want to provide liquidity, instead of spreading it
      evenly across all possible prices.

      3. By focusing their funds on a smaller price range, they can have a more
      significant impact on that range, which means their money is being used
      more effectively.

      4. This approach helps reduce the risk of impermanent loss, as it gives
      choice to the user over what range do they want to deposit the liquidity.

      5. Concentrated liquidity AMM also allows for better price stability and
      reduced slippage, which is the change in price when a trade is executed.
      This is important because high slippage can lead to unfavorable trade
      outcomes.


      In a nutshell, concentrated liquidity AMM helps people get more out of
      their money by allowing them to focus their liquidity where it's needed
      most, reducing risks and providing better trading experiences for users.

      data-plyr-embed-id="ClWR1570UQw"></div>


      ### Concentrated Liquidity Example

      Let's say Alice, Bob, and Carol want to provide liquidity to an ETH-USDC
      pool using a concentrated liquidity AMM. They each have an equal amount of
      ETH and USDC but want to deposit their funds over different price ranges.



      <div align="center">

      <img style="max-height:400px"
      src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/uniswap-eth-1/Guide/concentrated-liquidity-uniswap/1681575680046_concentrated_liquidity%20example.png"/>

      </div>


      Now, the ETH-USDC pool has separate areas of concentrated liquidity:


      As long as the price of ETH stays within their chosen ranges, Alice, Bob,
      and Carols's funds will be actively used to facilitate trades. If the
      price moves outside of their chosen ranges, their liquidity will not be
      used, and they won't earn fees from trades happening outside their
      specified price ranges.


      By focusing their liquidity on narrower price ranges, Alice, Bob, and
      Carols can provide more substantial support for the market within those
      ranges. This leads to better price stability, reduced slippage, and
      potentially higher returns from trading fees for each of them.

      We can examine some instances to understand how concentrated liquidity
      operates and how liquidity providers make profits, depending on their
      position within the range and the level of liquidity concentration. This
      is determined by the narrowness of the range in which liquidity is
      provided.


      ## Scenario 1 

      <div align="center">

      <img style="max-height:400px"
      src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/uniswap-eth-1/Guide/concentrated-liquidity-uniswap/1681588401410_example_scenario_1.png"/>

      </div>

      <br/>

      Alice and Carlos have sufficient liquidity within range, but Bob's
      liquidity lies outside the range since he provided $2000-$2500. Alice
      earned more fees than Carlos, even though they both offered the same
      liquidity. This is because Alice has a higher concentration of liquidity.


      ## Scenario 2


      <div align="center">

      <img style="max-height:400px"
      src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/uniswap-eth-1/Guide/concentrated-liquidity-uniswap/1681920255744_05_concentrated_example_scenario_2.png"/>

      </div>


      In this scenario the liquidity is out of range for both Alice and Bob, but
      is in rage for Carlos.

      When creating a position in a Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market
      Maker (AMM) like Uniswap V3, there are several key points to keep in mind
      to ensure an optimal strategy and manage risks effectively:


      1. Token Pair: Select the token pair for which you want to provide
      liquidity. It is crucial to understand the underlying assets, their price
      movements, and their potential correlations.

      2. Price Range: Define a price range for the liquidity provision. This
      range determines at which prices your liquidity will be active. Choosing a
      suitable range is essential to maximize your returns, as liquidity will
      only be utilized and generate fees when the price is within this range.

      3. Position Size: Consider the size of your liquidity provision based on
      your risk tolerance, investment strategy, and the amount of capital you're
      willing to allocate. Remember that larger positions may be subject to
      higher impermanent loss risks.

      4. Liquidity Provider (LP) Fees: Understand the fees associated with
      providing liquidity. In Uniswap V3, the fees depend on the chosen fee tier
      (0.05%, 0.30%, or 1.00%). Assess the trade-off between higher fees and
      potential trading volume to optimize your returns.

      5. Impermanent Loss: Be aware of the potential for impermanent loss, which
      can occur when the price of the underlying assets changes relative to when
      you deposited them. The concentrated nature of liquidity in Uniswap V3 can
      lead to higher impermanent loss compared to other AMMs.

      6. Active Management: Concentrated liquidity often requires more active
      management than traditional AMMs. Monitor your position, and adjust the
      price range or liquidity provision as needed to adapt to changing market
      conditions.

      7. Gas Fees: Keep in mind that interacting with smart contracts on the
      Ethereum network incurs gas fees. These fees can vary depending on network
      congestion and should be factored into your overall investment strategy.


      By considering these points and conducting thorough research, you can
      create an effective position in a concentrated liquidity AMM and manage
      your risks accordingly.
