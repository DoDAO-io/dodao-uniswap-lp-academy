      . Uniswap V3 liquidity providers specify the price range

      [𝑆𝑙, 𝑆𝑢] in which they wish to supply liquidity (cf. Figure 2b). Their

      liquidity then only supports trading within this price range. Thus,

      Uniswap V3 has an increased liquidity concentration around the

      current price and thereby increases the market’s capital efficiency.

      We note that liquidity providers can only choose the price boundaries of
      their liquidity position from a predefined set of the pool’s

      initialized ticks. There is a tick at every integer exponent of 1.0001,

      and the price of tick 𝑖 (𝑖 ∈ Z) is given by


      𝑆 (𝑖) = 1.0001𝑖

      .

      Consequently, each tick is 0.01% (one basis points (bps)) away from

      each neighboring tick. Not every tick can be initialized in a pool,

      instead, only ticks with indexes divisible by the pool’s predefined

      tick spacing (𝑡𝑠 ) can be initialized. Figure 2c shows a schematic

      representation of a liquidity allocation across a liquidity pool’s

      price range. The liquidity is no longer constant across the entire

      price range, instead, only between the pool’s initialized ticks.

      Uniswap V3 utilizes the concept of virtual reserves, adjusted

      larger reserves, to describe the pool’s behavior between two adjacent
      ticks 𝑇𝑙 and 𝑇𝑢. The virtual reserves act as if the liquidity

      in the entire pool matches that of the current price range. Thus,

      the virtual reserves of the current price range are a transformation

      of the range’s real reserves that allow for the application of the

      constant product formula. In the following we consider a pool with

      reserves 𝑥real and 𝑦real between two adjacent ticks. The price range

      between ticks 𝑇𝑙 and 𝑇𝑢 is given by [𝑆𝑙

      , 𝑆𝑢]. Instead of ensuring

      that the product between the reserves stays constant, the protocol ensures
      that the product of the virtual reserves 𝑥 and 𝑦 stays

      constant, i.e.,


      ```

      𝑥 · 𝑦 = 𝐿^2

      ```


      where 𝐿 the liquidity reserved in between ticks 𝑇𝑙 and 𝑇𝑢 [14].

      Further, the marginal price is given by 𝑆 = 𝑦/𝑥. The following

      relationship then holds between the virtual reserves, liquidity, and

      marginal price:


      𝑥 = 𝐿√ 𝑆


      𝑦 = 𝐿√𝑆.


      Thus, the virtual reserves behave according to the constant product

      price curve as shown in Figure 1. Similarly, the real reserves can be

      obtained as follows:


      𝑥real = 𝑥 − 𝐿√𝑆𝑢 = 𝐿√𝑆 − 𝐿√𝑆𝑢


      𝑦real = 𝑦 − 𝐿√︁𝑆𝑙 = 𝐿√𝑆 − 𝐿√︁𝑆𝑙.


      Observe that the pool only needs to maintain sufficient reserves to

      support trading within the price boundaries [𝑆𝑙, 𝑆𝑢]. Thus, the real

      reserves of 𝑋-token shrink as the value of 𝑋 in terms of 𝑌 increases

      and are fully depleted at the upper price boundary 𝑆𝑢. The opposite

      holds for the real reserves of 𝑌-token.
