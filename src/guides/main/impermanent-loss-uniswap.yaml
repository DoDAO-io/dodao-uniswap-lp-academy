      ### What is Impermanent Loss?


      Impermanent loss is a phenomenon experienced by liquidity providers in
      automated market makers (AMMs) when the value of their deposited assets
      changes compared to the initial deposit. This change in value can cause
      the provider's share of the pool to be worth less than if they had held
      the assets separately. Impermanent loss is influenced by the degree of
      price divergence between the assets in the pool and can be either
      temporary or permanent. Although it exposes liquidity providers to
      potential losses, trading fees can counteract the impact of impermanent
      loss, making it profitable to provide liquidity under various conditions.



      ### How Does It Occur?

      Impermanent loss occurs when liquidity providers deposit assets into an
      AMM's liquidity pool, and the prices of those assets change relative to
      each other. AMMs do not automatically adjust their prices based on
      external markets; they rely on arbitrageurs to buy underpriced assets or
      sell overpriced assets until the AMM's prices match external market
      prices. During this process, arbitrageurs extract profits, which come at
      the expense of liquidity providers, resulting in impermanent loss. If the
      relative prices of tokens in the AMM return to their original state, the
      impermanent loss disappears, and liquidity providers earn trading fees.
      However, if the prices do not return to their original levels, impermanent
      loss can become permanent, reducing the providers' overall returns.

      Let's consider an example of two friends, Alice and Bob, who each have
      $10,000 worth of assets. Alice decides to provide liquidity to a ETH-USDC
      pool, while Bob decides to hold on to his ETH. Let's assume that at the
      time of deposit, 1 ETH is worth $2,000, and Alice has 2.5 ETH and $5,000
      in USDC.


      Alice adds her assets to the ETH-USDC liquidity pool, depositing 2.5 ETH
      and $5,000 USDC. 


      Assume the pool had a 50:50 ratio of ETH to USDC and the asstes before
      Alice's deposit were 2.5 ETH and $5,000 USDC. After Alice's added her
      assets, the pool's assets are now 5 ETH and $10,000 USDC.  


      Bob, on the other hand, keeps his 5 ETH and doesn't participate in the
      liquidity pool.


      Now, let's say the price of ETH increases to $4,000. At this point, Bob's
      5 ETH is now worth $20,000, a 100% increase in value.


      In the liquidity pool, arbitrageurs will take advantage of the price
      difference by trading USDC for ETH. This will result in the pool holding
      more USDC and less ETH. Let's assume that after the arbitrage activity,
      the pool has a new balance of 4 ETH and $11,000 USDC.


      Since Alice contributed 50% of the pool's liquidity, her share of the
      assets in the pool is now 2 ETH (worth $8,000) and $5,500 USDC, for a
      total value of $13,500. This is an increase of 35% compared to her initial
      deposit.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/uniswap-eth-1/Guide/impermanent_loss_uniswap/1695687177547_impermanent_loss%20example.png"/>
      </div>



      In this example, Alice experiences impermanent loss due to the change in
      the value of ETH relative to USDC. If Alice had held onto her 5 ETH like
      Bob, her assets would now be worth $20,000, a 100% increase.


      Impermanent loss is the difference between the value of the assets if
      Alice had held them separately and the value of her share in the liquidity
      pool. In this case, Alice's impermanent loss is $20,000 (the value if she
      had held her assets) - $13,500 (the value of her share in the liquidity
      pool) = $6,500.

      ### Impermanent Loss Maths

      Here we take the example of Uniswap V2 as the maths is much easier to
      understand.

      ### Factors Impacting Impermanent Loss 


      The factors that impact impermanent loss are:


      1. **Price volatility**: The greater the price volatility of the assets in
      a liquidity pool, the higher the potential for impermanent loss. As the
      prices of the assets in the pool diverge, the value of the LP's position
      can become less than if they had simply held onto the assets.


      2. **Asset correlation**: The degree to which the assets in the liquidity
      pool are correlated can also impact impermanent loss. If the assets are
      positively correlated, their prices will generally move in the same
      direction, potentially reducing impermanent loss. However, if the assets
      are negatively correlated or have no correlation, their prices may diverge
      more, increasing the risk of impermanent loss.


      3. **Time in the pool**: The duration for which a liquidity provider keeps
      their assets in the pool can impact impermanent loss. Generally, the
      longer an LP's assets stay in the pool, the greater the chance that the
      assets' prices will diverge, leading to impermanent loss. However, it's
      essential to note that impermanent loss can also be mitigated over time as
      fees earned from the pool can offset the loss.

      Although impermanent loss is inevitable. However, there are measures that
      can be taken to mitigate this risk. They are discussed below:


      1. **Use concentrated liquidity pools**: Uniswap V3 offers concentrated
      liquidity pools where LPs can specify a price range for their assets. By
      setting a narrower price range, LPs can limit their exposure to
      impermanent loss, although they may not earn fees if the trading pair's
      price moves outside the specified range.

      2. **Choose less volatile token pairs**: By providing liquidity to pairs
      with lower price volatility, such as stablecoin pairs, LPs can minimize
      the potential for impermanent loss due to their lower price fluctuations.

      3. **Monitor the market and adjust your strategy accordingly**: Keeping an
      eye on market conditions and adjusting your strategy as needed can help
      reduce the risk of experiencing impermanent loss on Uniswap V3.

      4. **Utilize risk management tools**: Some DeFi platforms offer risk
      management tools that allow you to set limits on your trades or
      automatically adjust your positions to minimize the risk of loss. These
      tools can also be helpful when trading on Uniswap V3. **It is important to
      be aware of the security risks associated with using third party tools.**


      It is important to note that impermanent loss is only "realized" when a
      liquidity provider withdraws their assets from the pool. If the prices of
      the assets return to their initial levels before withdrawal, the
      impermanent loss is effectively negated.
