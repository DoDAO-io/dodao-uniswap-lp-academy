      ### What is Impermanent Loss?


      Impermanent loss is a phenomenon experienced by liquidity providers in
      automated market makers (AMMs) when the value of their deposited assets
      changes compared to the initial deposit. This change in value can cause
      the provider's share of the pool to be worth less than if they had held
      the assets separately. Impermanent loss is influenced by the degree of
      price divergence between the assets in the pool and can be either
      temporary or permanent. Although it exposes liquidity providers to
      potential losses, trading fees can counteract the impact of impermanent
      loss, making it profitable to provide liquidity under various conditions.



      ### How Does It Occur?

      Impermanent loss occurs when liquidity providers deposit assets into an
      AMM's liquidity pool, and the prices of those assets change relative to
      each other. AMMs do not automatically adjust their prices based on
      external markets; they rely on arbitrageurs to buy underpriced assets or
      sell overpriced assets until the AMM's prices match external market
      prices. During this process, arbitrageurs extract profits, which come at
      the expense of liquidity providers, resulting in impermanent loss. If the
      relative prices of tokens in the AMM return to their original state, the
      impermanent loss disappears, and liquidity providers earn trading fees.
      However, if the prices do not return to their original levels, impermanent
      loss can become permanent, reducing the providers' overall returns.

      Let's consider an example of two friends, Alice and Bob, who each have
      $10,000 worth of assets. Alice decides to provide liquidity to a USDC-ETH
      pool, while Bob decides to hold on to his ETH. Let's assume that at the
      time of deposit, 1 ETH is worth $2,000, and Alice has 5 ETH and $5,000 in
      USDC.


      Alice adds her assets to the USDC-ETH liquidity pool, depositing 5 ETH and
      $5,000 USDC. The pool now has a 50:50 ratio of USDC to ETH.


      Bob, on the other hand, keeps his 5 ETH and doesn't participate in the
      liquidity pool.


      Now, let's say the price of ETH increases to $4,000. At this point, Bob's
      5 ETH is now worth $20,000, a 100% increase in value.


      In the liquidity pool, arbitrageurs will take advantage of the price
      difference by trading USDC for ETH. This will result in the pool holding
      more USDC and less ETH. Let's assume that after the arbitrage activity,
      the pool has a new balance of 4 ETH and $11,000 USDC.


      Since Alice contributed 50% of the pool's liquidity, her share of the
      assets in the pool is now 2 ETH (worth $8,000) and $5,500 USDC, for a
      total value of $13,500. This is an increase of 35% compared to her initial
      deposit.

      In this example, Alice experiences impermanent loss due to the change in
      the value of ETH relative to USDC. If Alice had held onto her 5 ETH like
      Bob, her assets would now be worth $20,000, a 100% increase.


      Impermanent loss is the difference between the value of the assets if
      Alice had held them separately and the value of her share in the liquidity
      pool. In this case, Alice's impermanent loss is $20,000 (the value if she
      had held her assets) - $13,500 (the value of her share in the liquidity
      pool) = $6,500.

      1. Price volatility: The main factor contributing to impermanent loss is
      the price volatility of the assets in the liquidity pool. If the price of
      one asset in the pair appreciates or depreciates significantly compared to
      the other, it can lead to a larger impermanent loss.

      2. Pool's token weights: Token weights in the liquidity pool can also
      impact impermanent loss. In most AMMs, the weights are 50/50, meaning that
      both tokens contribute equally to the pool's value. However, some pools
      have different weights, which can affect the extent of the impermanent
      loss.

      3. Trading volume: Trading volume in the pool affects the fees earned by
      liquidity providers, which can help offset impermanent loss. Higher
      trading volumes generate more fees, potentially mitigating the impact of
      impermanent loss.

      1. Choose less volatile token pairs: By providing liquidity to pairs with
      lower price volatility, LPs can minimize the potential for impermanent
      loss. Stablecoin pairs, for example, can have lower impermanent loss due
      to their lower price fluctuations.

      2. Utilize liquidity pool insurance: Some DeFi platforms offer insurance
      products to help protect LPs against impermanent loss. These insurance
      products can help to offset potential losses, but they usually come with a
      cost in the form of premiums.

      3. Use concentrated liquidity pools: Some AMMs, like Uniswap V3, offer
      concentrated liquidity pools where LPs can specify a price range for their
      assets. By setting a narrower price range, LPs can limit their exposure to
      impermanent loss. However, it also means they may not earn fees if the
      trading pair's price moves outside of the specified range.

      4. Explore other DeFi platforms and strategies: Various DeFi platforms
      employ different mechanisms to address impermanent loss, such as dynamic
      weights or different token swap models. Exploring alternative platforms or
      strategies can help LPs find ways to mitigate impermanent loss risks.


      It is important to note that impermanent loss is only "realized" when a
      liquidity provider withdraws their assets from the pool. If the prices of
      the assets return to their initial levels before withdrawal, the
      impermanent loss is effectively negated.

      How to avoid impermanent loss

      Trading fees can often help to offset impermanent loss while token rewards
      can lead to higher overall returns than would have been achieved through a
      buy and hold strategy. But this is not the only way to reduce the risk of
      impermanent loss or even avoid it altogether.


      Low volatility pairs


      Choosing less volatile asset pairs naturally reduces the risk of one or
      both of the assets experiencing a significant change in value, and
      therefore reduces the risk of impermanent loss. This could be stablecoin
      pairs such as USDT and DAI. However, more volatile pools may still be
      attractive because of higher rewards.


      Different types of liquidity pools


      Not all liquidity pools require you to add assets at a 50:50 ratio.
      Considering a different type of liquidity pool could help manage the risk
      of impermanent loss. However, these types of pools are more complex, so
      prior knowledge and a good understanding of DeFi is required.


      For example, some decentralized exchanges offer a variety of liquidity
      pool ratios. A pool with a 50:50 ratio would leave an LP open to a higher
      impermanent loss risk than a pool with a 80:20 ratio, for example (where
      the 20% is the ratio of the more volatile asset). There are also complex
      liquidity pools with more than two digital assets available. In addition,
      some exchanges have developed liquidity pools where you can stake just one
      of the assets inside the pool, while the other side of the pool consists
      of the platformâ€™s native token.

      How to Avoid Impermanent Loss in Cryptocurrency

      Although impermanent loss is inevitable. However, there are measures that
      can be taken to mitigate this risk. They are discussed below,


      1. Choose Stablecoin Pair that Offer the best

      One strategy to avoid temporary loss is to choose stablecoin pairs that
      offer the best bet against impermanent loss. This is because their value
      does not move much. They also have fewer arbitrage opportunities, lowering
      the risks. Liquidity providers using stablecoin pairs, on the other hand,
      are unable to gain from the bullish crypto market.


      2. Choose Pairs that do not expose liquidity to market stability

      You need to choose tokens (ETH base & stablecoin pair) that do not expose
      liquidity to market stability. Cryptos with an unstable history or high
      volatility should not be considered. Another strategy to avoid temporary
      loss is to search the market, which is highly volatile thoroughly.


      3. Timing

      Liquidity providers must also know when to sell their holdings before the
      price drifts too far from the starting rates. This would help to curtail
      the effect of a change in price.


      4. Look beyond the loss

      One of the best ways to overcome impermanent loss is to look beyond it.
      The tokens youâ€™ve committed already have a purpose, which is to earn you
      trading fees. Let them do their job for the more you put into the
      equation.

      How To Avoid Impermanent Loss?

      There are several ways to avoid or minimize the risk of impermanent loss
      when trading on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that use automated
      market makers (AMMs):


      Use Stop Loss Orders

      A stop loss order is an order to sell an asset at a certain price to limit
      potential losses. By setting a stop loss order at a certain percentage
      below your entry price, you can minimize the risk of experiencing an
      impermanent loss due to a significant price change.


      Use AMMs With Low Slippage

      Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the
      actual price at which the trade is executed. AMMs with low slippage is
      less likely to experience significant price changes between when a trade
      is executed and when it is settled, reducing the risk of impermanent loss.


      Monitor the Market and Adjust Your Strategy Accordingly

      Keeping an eye on market conditions and adjusting your trading strategy as
      needed can help reduce the risk of experiencing an impermanent loss. For
      example, if you expect a significant price change in the near future, you
      may want to adjust your trading strategy to minimize the risk of
      impermanent loss.


      Use a Risk Management Tool

      Various tools can help you manage and minimize the risk of impermanent
      loss. For example, some DeFi platforms offer risk management tools that
      allow you to set limits on your trades or automatically adjust your
      positions to minimize the risk of loss.


      It is important to note that while these strategies can help reduce the
      risk of impermanent loss, they do not guarantee that you will not
      experience a loss. Trading on DeFi platforms carries inherent risks, and
      it is important to thoroughly understand these risks and carefully
      consider whether DeFi trading is right for you.
