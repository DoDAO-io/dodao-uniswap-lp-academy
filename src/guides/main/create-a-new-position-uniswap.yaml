      Uniswap V3 enables Liquidity Providers to concentrate their capital within
      specific price ranges, allowing them to provide more liquidity at
      preferred prices. Unlike Uniswap V2, which required all users to provide
      liquidity across the entire price curve from 0 to infinity, Uniswap V3
      allows LPs to selectively allocate capital within the price range they
      anticipate to yield the highest return.


      This tutorial will guide you through the process of providing liquidity
      using the Uniswap application.


      ## Select Pair

      To start, you need to choose which token pair you want to supply as
      liquidity.


      While any pair of ERC-20 tokens is acceptable, each pair has distinct
      qualities. It would be helpful to evaluate aspects such as Total Value
      Locked (TVL), trading volume, and the possibility of price divergence
      between these tokens in the future.


      You can access relevant information about frequently traded token pairs on
      [Uniswap Info](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools)

      After selecting a token pair, the next step is to choose the appropriate
      fee tier. Uniswap V3 offers three fee tiers for each pair:


      1. 0.01% fee tier: suitable for stablecoin pairs with minimal price risk
      and fees.

      2. 0.05% fee tier: suitable for stabler pairs.

      3. 0.30% fee tier: best for less correlated token pairs that are more
      exposed to significant price movements.

      4. 1.00% fee tier: designed for exotic assets that are highly prone to
      price volatility.

      The app will automatically choose the fee tier with the most liquidity,
      which is typically the consensus fee tier. In most cases, LPs align around
      one fee tier for a pair. For instance, the 0.3% tier has 82% of all
      ETH/USDC liquidity.


      If you're new to LP-ing, it's recommended to use the auto-selected fee
      tier. Nonetheless, advanced strategies might find it valuable to provide
      liquidity in the other fee tiers. Keep in mind that LPs who pick a
      non-consensus fee tier might be using a complex approach to counter
      certain risks. It's important to do your own research and proceed with
      caution when evaluating other fee tiers.

      To provide liquidity in Uniswap V3, you need to select a specific price
      range. It's important to consider the potential price movements of the
      assets and your willingness to actively manage the position as the market
      changes. If the price moves beyond the specified range, your position will
      be concentrated in one asset and won't earn trading fees until it returns
      to the range. You can also choose to provide liquidity across the full
      range, but the rate of return will be lower. Tools like the Flipside
      Uniswap V3 calculator and Defi-lab.xyz can help evaluate the price range,
      but they are not audited by Uniswap Labs and may not be entirely accurate.
